### Seapoint Swimming Club 

This project was designed for the ficticious seapoint swimming club. It is primarily aimed at
existing members to see upcoming events and to check on the weather conditions and tide times for the week ahead.
As sea swimming is highly dependent on tide times and weather conditons , i thought having both of these on the same page 
would be very useful for somebody to plan their swimming scedule for the week.
It is also designed to recruit new members and give some information about the health benefits of sea swimming.

UX 
As this website is aimed at both old and new members to sea swimming i wanted it to be simple,visually imressive and easy to navigate.
As the target user for sea swimming can be any age I wanted to keep it simple enough to cater for the wide range in demographics.

User Stories:

As a veteran sea swimmer I can easily check the time high tide is at so I can the best times to swim.

As someone who is interested in sea swimming , I can see what date there is an upcoming beginners swim that I could take part and I can also
check the weather conditions on the day so I can make sure it's sutible for me.

FEATURES 
This website consists of 4 pages:
Home/Landing Page : This consists of a visually pleasing picture of the sea and the sites logo,name and a tag line. It also consists of a top
nav bar plus additional icons underneath the main image which also acts as a nav bar and also a small about us section and social media links.
these features are consistant in every page on the website

About: This features a section about seapoint swimming club itself and also some additional sections about the benefits of sea swimming
designed to both inform and inspire people to take the plunge into cold water.

Events: This features a calender of dates of upcoming events and also some details of what the events are.

Tides: This page includes a table of the weather forecast for the next 7 days which features the date ,max temperature and conditions 
for the upcoming week. It also inlcudes a 7 day tide time forcast which features the date and both the first and second high tide times so users
can plan what the best time to swim to suit their needs is. 

FEATURES LEFT TO IMPLEMENT:
it would be great in the future to add some additional features such as a forum where users can talk about the conditions or anything out of 
the ordinary like seal sightings and bad water conditions or add some photos of their swim and views of the sea.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
Bootstrap 4: This project uses Bootstrap 4 for layout purposes     Link:https://getbootstrap.com/
Font Awesome: This project uses Fontawesome for Icons              link:https://fontawesome.com/

Google Fonts: This project uses Google fonts roboto for body text  link:https://fonts.google.com/


TESTING
I have tested that all links work as intended and the layout suits all screen sizes.
I encountered some problems when viewing on a mobile device such as on the landing page, the logo looked too big
and was nested too close to the top of the screen. I fixed this by adding a media query which reduces the size pf the logo 
and the text aswell as adding some padding to the top so it doesnt hug the top like it did previously.


DEPLOYMENT:
I deployed the site using git hub.
