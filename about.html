            <h2>Welcome to Seapoint Swimming Club</h2>

            <p class="abt-text">Seapoint Swimming Club is a ficticious organisation established in 2019 for the purpose of a project. We cater for all ages and abilities from teenagers to senior citizens and from novice swimmers to former internationals. So if you like a
                challenge, keeping fit and enjoy meeting people of all levels of swimming ability – we’d love to have you join us on one of our many sea swims during the summer months. For current news, check out our Facebook, Twitter or YouTube pages
            </p>

            <h2>Health Benefits</h2>
            <div class="row no-gutters justify-content-around">
                <p class="abt-text col-sm-12 col-md-5 center no-gutters"></i>For years sea swimming has been associated with health benefits - there's even a word for it: thalassotherapy. The magnesium in seawater may also help hydrate and improve the appearance of your skin. According
                    to a study in the February 2005 edition of the International Journal of Dermatology, bathing in a magnesium-rich Dead Sea salt solution helps promote skin moisture.</p>

                <p class="abt-text col-sm-12 col-md-5 center no-gutters"></i>When we experience stress - such as getting into cold water - our heart and breathing rates increase. But the rate of this increase can be halved with regular short periods of immersion (between three and five
                    minutes) in cold water, according to a report in the Journal of Physiology.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <i class="far fa-smile fa-3x iconic"></i>
                <p class="abt-text">A study commissioned by Swim England to coincide with 'World Mental Health Day' found that when queried about the impact swimming has on their day-to-day life, 43pc of people who swim regularly said it makes them feel happier, 26pc are
                    more motivated to complete daily tasks while 15pc believe life feels more manageable.</p>
                <i class="fas fa-water fa-3x iconic"></i>
                <p class="abt-text">But all the studies in the world won't convince you until you try it. When you swim in cold water the body shuts down blood flow to the skin and extremities - it's why you can look a bit blue when you get out. But when you start to heat
                    up again and you feel the blood flowing back around the body again, it brings with it a kind of high, almost like a rush. It's a post-swim euphoria. It's totally natural and it's free.</p>
